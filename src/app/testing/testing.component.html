    <p>Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the
        software product or service under test.[1] Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of
        the
        software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Test
        techniques
        include the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs (errors or
        other
        defects), and verifying that the software product is fit for use.</p>

    <p>Software testing can provide objective, independent information about the quality of software and risk of its
        failure to
        users or sponsors.</p>

    <p>Software testing involves the execution of a software component or system component to evaluate one or more
        properties
        of interest. In general, these properties indicate the extent to which the component or system under test:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>meets the requirements that guided its design and development.
            </h3>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>responds correctly to all kinds of inputs.
            </h3>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>performs its functions within an acceptable time.
            </h3>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>it is sufficiently usable.
            </h3>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>achieves the general result its stakeholders desire.
            </h3>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>can be installed and run in its intended environments.
            </h3>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Software testing can be conducted as soon as executable software (even if partially complete) exists. The
        overall
        approach to software development often determines when and how testing is conducted. For example, in a phased
        process,
        most testing occurs after system requirements have been defined and then implemented in testable programs. In
        contrast,
        under an agile approach, requirements, programming, and testing are often done concurrently.
