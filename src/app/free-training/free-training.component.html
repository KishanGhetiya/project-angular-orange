    <h3>Training</h3>
    <p>Training is teaching, or developing in oneself or others, any skills and knowledge or fitness that relate to
        specific useful competencies. Training has specific goals of improving one's capability, capacity, productivity
        and performance. It forms the core of apprenticeships and provides the backbone of content at institutes of
        technology (also known as technical colleges or polytechnics). In addition to the basic training required for a
        trade, occupation or profession, training may continue beyond initial competence to maintain, upgrade and update
        skills throughout working life. People within some professions and occupations may refer to this sort of
        training as professional development. Training also refers to the development of physical fitness related to a
        specific competence, such as sport, martial arts, military applications and some other occupations.</p>
